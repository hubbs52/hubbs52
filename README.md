## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Ryan, and I am new to the Github community.

I am currently finishing a masters program in data analytics with an area of specialization in finance. Over the past few years, I have been developing my skills in SQL, R, SAS, Python, Alteryx, and various statistical and predictive modeling tools and techniques. 

In addition, I am a project manager for a large healthcare organization. I currently specialize in robotic process automation projects for finance teams. However, my team is also involved in AI projects.
